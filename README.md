# Explicit-exponentials
codes used for the article "High-order exponential integration for seismic wave modeling"

The files that start with the character: run_*   have the codes to run the experiments

Once having all the data, the files:

dispersion_tfourier_run      is used to produce the results of Section 4

graph_convergence_call       is used to construct all the figures of Section 5
